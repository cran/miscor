Description: Statistical test for the product-moment correlation coefficient based on H0: rho = rho0 
             including sample size computation, statistical test for comparing the product-moment 
             correlation coefficient in independent ad dependent samples, sequential triangular
             test for the product-moment correlation coefficient, partial and semipartial correlation,
             simulation of bivariate normal and non-normal distribution with a specified correlation.
